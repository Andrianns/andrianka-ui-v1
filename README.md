## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/andrianns-projects/v0-personal-website-content](https://vercel.com/andrianns-projects/v0-personal-website-content)**

## Build your app

Continue building your app on:

**[https://v0.app/chat/projects/PY6gAtqPJkQ](https://v0.app/chat/projects/PY6gAtqPJkQ)**

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or `.env.local`) and adjust the values to match your CMS deployment. The application expects the following keys:

- `VITE_CMS_API_URL`
- `VITE_CMS_DASHBOARD_URL`
- `VITE_CMS_LOGIN_URL`
- `VITE_CMS_NOTIFICATION_DURATION`

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository
